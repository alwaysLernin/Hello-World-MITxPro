<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h2>Relax and enjoy the ride.</h2>
<p>A long time ago, life was stressful because we had to worry about things like getting eaten by a sabertooth tiger. Back then, when the tiger was gone, we could relax a little.</p>
<p>Today, we don't have to worry about that tiger, but it seems that we've managed to find an infinite number of modern day tigers that keep us stressed all day long.</p>
<p>We all need to practice putting these new tigers away and relax.</p>
